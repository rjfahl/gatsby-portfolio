Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on Gatsby's website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

### Themes

- To learn more about Gatsby themes specifically, we recommend checking out the [theme docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/).

### General

- **For most developers, I recommend starting with the [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to Gatsby's documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Reference Guides_ and _Gatsby API_ sections in the sidebar.
